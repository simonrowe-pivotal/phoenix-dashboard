#Phoenix Web

This microservice runs on one foundation and provides a UI to surface aggregated foundation data.

### Getting Started
The web microservice depends on one RDBMS service:
* phoenix-db - this is a mysql service instance that holds the aggregated foundation data!

This service could be already created as part of the data-injestion module.
